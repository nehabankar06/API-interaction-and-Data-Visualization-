#DESCRIPTION

This Python script demonstrates how to simulate road accident data using a mock API approach and visualize the data using Matplotlib. It is designed to represent how real-time data from an actual API (such as government accident databases or open data platforms) can be fetched, processed, and visualized to analyze trends in road accidents over a period of time. The code follows three main steps: data simulation (mock API), data extraction, and data visualization.

Step 1: Simulating API Data

Since actual API integration is not performed here, the code uses a function called get_mock_accident_data() to simulate API responses. This function mimics a real-world API that would typically return accident data over the past few days. It generates accident data for the last 15 days dynamically.

Using Pythonâ€™s datetime module, the script calculates dates starting from 14 days before the current date up to today. For each date, a random number of accidents (between 100 and 300) is generated using Python's random.randint() function. This simulates variability in daily accident counts. The data is structured into a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary holds a date and its corresponding accident count. The function then returns a dictionary mimicking a typical API response with a status key and a data key containing the list of accident records.

Step 2: Fetching Data (Simulated API Response)

In a real API scenario, a requests.get() call would fetch JSON data from an online endpoint. Here, however, the mock function is called directly, simulating the process of fetching an API response. The returned JSON-like dictionary is stored in the response variable.

The script then parses the response by iterating through the data key. It extracts two lists:

dates: A list of date strings for the past 15 days.

accidents: A list of corresponding accident counts for each date.

These lists are prepared for visualization.

Step 3: Data Visualization using Matplotlib

The visualization phase uses Matplotlib, a popular Python plotting library, to create a line graph representing the trend of road accidents over the last 15 days. A figure is initialized with a size of 12x6 inches for better clarity.

A line plot is generated where:

The X-axis represents dates.

The Y-axis represents the number of accidents per day.

The plot uses orange-colored lines with circular markers (marker='o', color='orange') to highlight individual data points for each date.

To enhance readability:

The title of the plot is set as "Simulated Daily Road Accidents (Last 15 Days)".

X-axis labels (dates) are rotated 45 degrees using plt.xticks(rotation=45) to avoid label overlap.

Grid lines are added for better visual guidance.

The plt.tight_layout() method ensures that labels and titles are adjusted within the plot area, preventing clipping of text.


Finally, plt.show() displays the graph.
